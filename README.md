## Course 1: Web Application Technologies and Django
##### Lecture
In this course, we learned the basic structure of a web application and received an introduction to some of the front-end and back-end technologies that we will utilize to create websites (HTML, CSS, SQL). I learned the history and implementation of the HTTP protocol and the request/response cycle, including GET/POST/PUT/Redirect. This courses utilizes PythonAnywhere to host our Django Application

##### Labs
In the labs for this course, we created a basic website to practice HTML and CSS, and we linked our sqlite database to a Django model, and used to admin panel and shell to read/write the database

##### Course Schedule
* Week 1: Introduction to Dynamic Web Content
* Week 2: Installing Django on PythonAnywhere
* Week 3: Hyptertext Markup Language
* Week 4: Cascading Style Shets
* Week 5: Introduction Structured Query Language (SQL)

## Course 2: Building Web Applications in Django
##### Lecture
In this course, we learned how to work with Django's opinion of Models and Views. Using Django's built-in ORM and sqlite3, we implement database access and django models. We reviwed OOP in preparation to learn Django's Class-based Views. We also learned how to create python scripts to load/unload our database.

##### Labs
The labs in this course included small apps to solidify our understanding of django models, templates, and views, and Django forms.

##### Course Schedule
* Week 1: Data Models
* Week 2: Django Views
* Week 3: Django Generic Views
* Week 4: Forms in HTTP and HTML

## Course 3: Django Features and Libraries
##### Lecture
In this course, we expand on Django features that are used to create good experiences for the end-user. We explored how Django handles both Cookies and Sessions, and the user authentication and login processes. We built out navigation within our pages, and many smaller django apps together to demonstrate CRUD operations, cookies and sessions, and different model types.

##### Labs
In the labs, we built out a number of smaller webapps to demonstrate understanding of cookies/sessions, and CRUD operations within Django. We got functioning simple image import and display, and began work on our 'capstone' project of an Ads website.

##### Course Schedule
* Week 1: Cookies and Sessions
* Week 2: Users and Authenticaiton
* Week 3: Django Forms
* Week 4: One to Many Data Models
* Week 5: Owned Rows
* Week 6: Many to Many Data Models

## Course 4: Using JavaScript, JQuery, and JSON in Django
##### Lecture
In this final course, we look at an introduction and history to JavaScript and how it can be used to manipulate the virutal DOM to help us work with web pages dynamically. We explore JavaScript syntax and functions, as well as other FP and OOP parts of JavaScript. Afterwards, we explore how to jQuery libary came about, and how we can use it in our project for DOM manipulation and event handling. Additionally, we learn the JSON format and how to serialize/deserialize this request type with Django. Finally, we receive an introduction to AJAX and explore how it can be used to create Single Page Applications (SPA).

##### Labs
In the labs, we complete building out our Ads capstone project. We add functionality for adding user favourites, search functionality, and tag functonality. We also implement social login (github), update our favicon, and implement bootstrap and crispy forms to improve the aesthetic of our website.

##### Course Schedule
* Week 1: JavaScript
* Week 2: Object Oriented JavaScript
* Week 3: jQuery
* Week 4: JSON/AJAX
* Week 5: Project
