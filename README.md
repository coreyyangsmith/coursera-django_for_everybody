We built out navigation within our pages, and many smaller django apps together to demonstrate CRUD operations, cookies and sessions, and different model types.

We explore JavaScript syntax and functions, as well as other FP and OOP parts of JavaScript. Afterwards, we explore how to jQuery libary came about, and how we can use it in our project for DOM manipulation and event handling. Additionally, we learn the JSON format and how to serialize/deserialize this request type with Django. Finally, we receive an introduction to AJAX and explore how it can be used to create Single Page Applications (SPA).

##### Labs
In the labs, we complete building out our Ads capstone project. We add functionality for adding user favourites, search functionality, and tag functonality. We also implement social login (github), update our favicon, and implement bootstrap and crispy forms to improve the aesthetic of our website.
